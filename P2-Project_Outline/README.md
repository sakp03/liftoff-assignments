# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For generations, family members have passed down recipes so that the next generation can enjoy. In many Asian families, these recipes are passed down by word of mouth and tend to not have units. I'm proposing to make a website that allows a user to either look at a recipe or add their version of that dish.

Users would be able to see the available dishes on hand and click to see the recipe. If they don't see a dish and know of a recipe, they can add a recipe to the list. If there is already a recipe for a dish, but the user wants to add a recipe they can click to add that recipe, and it would show up in the other versions list.

Eventually, the users should be able to search, filter, and sort for dishes and other versions of those dishes by equipment, time, ingredients, etc.

This idea came about when I started searching for recipes and found so many versions that I wished they were all in one place or at least one place that had a link to all the other sites. Its also very hard to look for a recipe where you know what the name is, but having others translate it to english with different ways of spelling the name so that it doesn't even show up on the search.

### Features
The main features of this website that will be implemented in this project will be:
1. User login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to the website. 
2. Create Recipe: Users will be able to create either a new recipe for a dish.
3. Update: Users will be able to update the site with other recipe versions of a dish, whether it be adding a new recipe or a link to another recipe.

### Technologies
Technologies that will be the following:
1. Java for the language
2. Spring Boot for the framework
3. MySQL for the database

### What I'll Have to Learn
One thing that I will have to learn is how to put an interactive map on the site. At some point, I want the users to be able to add a restaurant that has that dish. I also might want to add a bit of javascript to make my front-end more interactive.
